    <h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
    <p>
 <ul>     
      <li><a href="virginamerica.com">Virgin America</a></li>
      <li><a href="mixcloud.com">Mixcloud.com</a></p></li>
  </ul>
    <h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Virgin America uses large amounts of negative space with large font sizes and simple graphics to allow the user to focus on the content, frictionlesslly moving down the page through the ticket buying process.</li>
      <li>Mixcloud displays image "cards" in 3 large columns with good spacers between to help separate the content. The size of the images and track information below lend themselves to quick browsing.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>What makes them similar and diferent?</h2>
    <p>They're similar in that they use a great deal of negative space to help the user focus on the main content, without gratuitous content grafted on. They're different in the way they present their content. Mixcloud has a tile based gallery grid good for browsing consumable content. Virgin America uses the nature of vertical page scrolling to guide site viewers a kind of narrative that leads them eventually to purchasing a flight ticket. </p>
